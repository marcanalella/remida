        Hi, I'm Paolo Favata. I have worked in the world of interiors for many years and understand the problem that people face of wanting to create a lovely home whilst lacking the time, confidence or contacts to achieve it as easily as they would like. And so I founded Remida Properties Solutions, to help you to build what you need.


        Based on the principle that you will be happier when your home suits you and the way that you choose to live, we put you at the centre of the process in everything we do.


        At Remida we take on all aspects of residential and commercial painting, decorating and feature design walls and ceiling from plasterboard to suit your plans for both interior and exterior jobs to improve and give a character to your property.


        We have experience and expertise in renovations, alterations and refurbishment. We love working with design plans, transforming the project into your dream house.
